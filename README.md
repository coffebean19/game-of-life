# game-of-life
An adaption of Johan Conway's mathematical game, Game of life.

Just part of my understanding the topic my research project is based on, swarm intelligence.

To do list:
	1. Fix the pane. It is not coded as a tortus pane at current.
	2. Make it able to create a pane with differing lengths and widths.
	3. Ease the process of making cells alive.
	4. Make output better looking and more customizable.
	5. Add more information on what the game of life actually is.
